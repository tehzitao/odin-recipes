        <h2>Vietnamese Beef Pho</h2>
        This pho lemongrass soup is served with a plate full of fresh garnishes and carious sauces - this allows each person to season their serving to taste.
        The soup is somewhat unusual because the meat is cooked in the serving bowl.
        The beef is sliced very thin, almost thin enough to see through;
        you might want to have the butcher slice it.
        The boiling hot broth is pored over the noodles and raw meat.
        The meat is quickly cooked in the hot broth while you garnish the soup.
